# PricePredictor
this project is related to Stock market prediction using LSTM model. In this case, i am using HDFCBANK stock price as the dataset to predict the next day's stock price. I have included 9 other models to compare the MAE, MSE and R2 scores. It will also analyse parameters using SHAP.
the dataset contains 1 year stock prices of HDFBANK.
i have added an old dataset as i ran this program a while back. 
You'll have to manually add the latest dataset from NSE's website:
